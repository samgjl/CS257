# Lab 2 -- SQL Lab
## Description
> The goal of today's lab is to teach you how to set up and test database tables on our database server, along with teaching you some simple SQL commands. We will be using an earthquakes data set, but you will later apply these skills to other data sets. <br>
> You are welcome to offer and receive help from your colleagues while doing this lab, but everyone must commit their own work to their own GitHub repository. (The Repository you set up during last week's lab)

## The Data:
The data is contained in ```lab-files```, specifically in ```earthquakeData.csv```. I have cleaned this to remove *all* rows with missing fields and columns that I found to be unreliable or uninteresting.

## Part 4
My experimentation for __Part 4__ is in ```part4.md```.

## Part 5
Part 5's queries are contained in ```earthquakequery.sql```, with (Readable version here: ```part5.md```).
