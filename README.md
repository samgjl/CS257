# CS257 Coursework

### Author: Sam Johnson-Lacoss

This repository contains my work (labs, homework, experimentation, etc.) for Carleton College's *Software Design* course. 

## Labs:
- **Lab 1: GitLab**
  - No specific directory, all deliverables will appear in the commit history.
- **Lab 2: SQL Lab**
  - All necessary files find themselves trapped in the ```sqllab``` folder.
- **Lab 3: Python Lab**
  - The files manifest in the ```pythonlab``` folder.
- **Lab 4: Flask Lab**
  - May the contents be discovered under the ```flasklab``` folder.
